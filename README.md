# ArtRoom

## Description
ArtRoom is an Android app that provides an interactive learning experience for people who visit art museums. Museum curators can attach Estimote Beacons next to each art piece, and when a visitor is near a piece of art, he/she can press a button and get information such as the artist, time period, and curator comments. The purpose of the app is to help people learn about art and to help them become more culturally aware.
