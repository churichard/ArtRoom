ArtRoom
=======
We created an Android app that provides an interactive experience for people who visit art museums and other sites of cultural heritage. Museum curators can buy Estimote iBeacons and attach one of them next to each art piece. Whenever a visitor has the ArtRoom app open and is near one of the iBeacons, then he/she can get information about the art piece and join a chatroom centered around discussing the art piece. The data about the art piece is pulled from a MongoDB server, the contents of which can be modified from a live website form that a museum curator can edit. Thus, the museum curator can convey whatever information he wants about the art piece, like the title, artist, description, his own thoughts about it, etc. This app is geared towards helping people learn more about art and helping them become more culturally aware.
